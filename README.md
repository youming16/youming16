## üëã Halo!

I'm Youming (Eric), a Computer Science student focuses on front-end development. My goal is to craft delightful designs that focus on user and turn them into pixel-perfect, high-performing websites or apps. I try to write code that is scalable, easy to maintain and read with future developers in mind.
